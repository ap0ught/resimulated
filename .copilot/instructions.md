# 🧠 Copilot Agent Instructions: Comment Enhancer + DEV_README Builder

Welcome, Copilot! Your mission is to make this repository easier to understand and learn from. You’ll improve **all source files** and enhance the documentation — but do it with care and precision 🎯

---

## 🔧 Code File Instructions

1. **Do not delete or replace any existing comments.**  
   - Preserve both single-line and multi-line comments in *all languages* (Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, Rust, C++, etc.)
   - Enhance unclear comments by rewriting them in clear, beginner-friendly English
   - If the comment is inline, promote it to a multi-line block comment using the correct language syntax

2. **Add comments where needed.**
   - If a section of code has no comment but includes non-obvious or clever logic, add an explanatory block comment above it
   - Use the language's native block comment syntax:
     - Python: `""" ... """`
     - JS/TS: `/** ... */`
     - Go/C++/Rust: `/* ... */`

3. **No emojis in code comments.**
   - Keep code comments clean and professional
